# Boxoffice Frontend

This is the frontend client for the Boxoffice application. It is a modern **React** application built with **Vite** that provides a fast, responsive user interface for browsing movies, booking tickets, and managing the application as an administrator.

It consumes the RESTful API provided by the `/backend` service.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Movie Discovery**: Browse and search for movies currently playing in your city.
* **Theater Filtering**: Filter movies by theater, showtime, date, and more.
* **Interactive Seat Selection**: A visual seat map for selecting specific seats in a theater.
* **Full Booking Workflow**: A multi-step process for booking, summary, and payment.
* **User Authentication**: Secure user registration (with OTP), login, and profile management.
* **Order History**: Users can view all their past bookings.
* **Admin Dashboard**: A separate, protected area for admins to perform CRUD operations on movies, theaters, shows, and users, and to view analytics.
* **Protected Routes**: User and Admin routes are protected using React Context and custom hooks.

## ðŸš€ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to run the frontend server locally.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required npm packages.
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
````

### 2\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the `frontend` directory. This file is for local development and should not be committed to Git.

It must contain the URL of the running backend server:

```.env
# The full URL to your backend API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

### 3\. Run the Development Server

Once your `.env.local` file is configured and your backend is running, you can start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start (usually on `http://localhost:5173`) with hot-reloading enabled.

-----

## ðŸ“¦ Available Scripts

  * **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite development server.
  * **`npm run build`**: Compiles and bundles the React app for production.
  * **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally to test it before deploying.

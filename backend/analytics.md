For a complete admin analytics dashboard for your project, you should include metrics covering four key areas: **Sales & Revenue**, **Booking & Occupancy**, **User Behavior**, and **Movie Performance**.

## Key Metrics & KPIs (The Dashboard View)

This is the main screen your admin will see, offering a high-level overview of the system's health.

* **Total Revenue:** Displayed prominently with filters for Today, This Week, This Month, and a custom date range.
* **Bookings Today:** A simple count of bookings made on the current day.
* **Average Occupancy Rate:** The average percentage of seats filled across all active shows.
* **Top Performing Movie (by Revenue):** The highest-grossing movie for the current week.
* **Top Performing Theater (by Revenue):** The theater generating the most revenue this week.

## Sales & Revenue Reports

These reports provide a detailed breakdown of all financial data.

* **Revenue Over Time:** A line chart showing daily, weekly, or monthly revenue to identify trends and peak periods. 
* **Revenue by Movie:** A bar chart or table ranking movies by the total revenue they've generated.
* **Revenue by Theater/Cinema:** A breakdown of revenue generated by each cinema location, helping to identify the most profitable venues.
* **Revenue by City:** A report comparing sales performance across different cities.

## Booking & Occupancy Analytics

This section focuses on how your shows and seats are being utilized.

* **Booking Volume:** A chart showing the number of bookings over time. This helps in understanding booking patterns (e.g., more bookings on weekends).
* **Seat Occupancy Rate:**
    * **By Movie:** Which movies are best at filling seats?
    * **By Theater:** Which theaters have the highest and lowest occupancy?
    * **By Show Time:** Are evening shows consistently fuller than afternoon matinees?
* **Booking Status Analysis:** A pie chart showing the distribution of `Booking_Status` (Paid, Cancelled, Expired). A high number of "Expired" bookings could indicate issues in the payment flow.

## User & Customer Analytics

This area provides insights into your user base.

* **New vs. Returning Users:** A simple metric showing how many new users are registering and how many existing users are making repeat bookings.
* **Booking Frequency:** An analysis of how often users book tickets.
* **Top Spenders:** A list of users who have spent the most money, which can be used for loyalty programs.

## Technical Implementation Suggestions

To build this, you'll need to:
1.  **Create New Admin API Endpoints:** Add a new route file, perhaps `adminAnalytics.js`, with endpoints like `/api/admin/analytics/revenue-over-time`.
2.  **Write Complex SQL Queries:** In your models (e.g., a new `analyticsModel.js`), you'll write queries using aggregate functions like `SUM(Amount)`, `COUNT(BookingID)`, `AVG(Occupancy)`, and `GROUP BY` clauses to group data by date, movie, or theater.
3.  **Implement a Date Range Filter:** All your analytics endpoints should accept `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters to allow the admin to filter the reports.
4.  **Visualize on Frontend:** Use a charting library (like Chart.js or Recharts) in your React admin panel to display the data as interactive charts and graphs.
